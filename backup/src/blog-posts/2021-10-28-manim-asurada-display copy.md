[Manim](https://github.com/3b1b/manim) is a python package for generatinng animations programmatically. It was originally developed by [Grant Sanderson](https://www.youtube.com/GrantSanderson) who have created the [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/3blue1brown) Youtube channel, where he shares videos teaching mathematical concepts in a visual manner. As a Python programming, I find this package very interesting and very powerful. Onne can use it to create beautiful and sophisticated animations by writing some lines of Python codes. In this post I will share how I used Manim to recreate an animation found in one of my favourite anime.
