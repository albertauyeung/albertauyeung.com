title: About Me
---

I am currently an AI Technical Manager at [Wisers AI Lab](https://www.wisers.ai). My interests in computer science lies in machine learning, natural language processing, social network analysis, data mining and other general A.I. problems.

Before joining Wisers, I was a machine learning lead engineer at Zwoop, a e-commerce startup in Hong Kong. I was the co-founder and CTO of Axon Labs Limited. My previous positions included researcher at Huawei's [Noah's Ark Lab](http://www.noahlab.com.hk/), senior engineer at the Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute ([ASTRI](http://www.astri.org/)), and research associate (post-doctoral researcher) at the [NTT Communication Science Laboratories](http://www.kecl.ntt.co.jp/rps/english/index_e.html) in Kyoto, Japan.

I received my PhD in Computer Science in the School of Electronics and Computer Science at the [University of Southampton](http://www.soton.ac.uk) in the U.K., under the supervision of [Prof. Nigel Shadbolt](http://www.jesus.ox.ac.uk/people/professor-sir-nigel-shadbolt) and [Dr. Nicholas Gibbins](http://users.ecs.soton.ac.uk/nmg/). My study was generously supported by the R C Lee Centenary Scholarship of Drs Richard Charles and Esther Yewpick Lee Charitable Foundation. My thesis studies 'collective semantics', which is about how implicit semantics and relationship can be extracted from social sharing activites, with a focus on user behaviours.

I obtained my M.Phil degree in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the [Chinese University of Hong Kong](http://www.cuhk.edu.hk). I finished my thesis on fuzzy ontologies under the supervision of [Prof. Leung Ho Fung](http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~lhf/). I obtained my B.Eng degree in Information Engineering in the same university.
