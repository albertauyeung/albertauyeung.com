"Kernels" are usually seen in the machine learning literature and have applications in many machine learning algorthms. This article aims at giving a friendly introduction to the concept and why kernels are useful in diffrent algorithms.

mapping input data into a high dimensional feature space defined by a kernal function
a function that returns the inner product (dot product) between the two data points in the feature space

support vector machine

the feature mapping is never effectively performed
"one does not even need to know what features are being used"
