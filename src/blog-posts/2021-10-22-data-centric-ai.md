# Data Centric AI

Recently there has been discussion on focusing more on the data rather than the model when working on machine learning tasks, such as the Data Centric-AI initiative advocated by Andrew Ng (see his talk on [MLOps: From Model-centric to Data-centric AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06-AZXmwHjo) and his [slides](https://www.deeplearning.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/MLOps-From-Model-centric-to-Data-centric-AI.pdf)). Two months ago, DeepLearning.AI organnized an event called [Data Centric AI: Real World Approaches](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yqj7Kyjznh4)), which contains some useful and practical ideas and suggestions on how to do data-centric AI.

DeepLearning.AI also hosted a [data-centric AI competition](https://https-deeplearning-ai.github.io/data-centric-comp/) earlier this year, and it was amazing to see how the performance of a fixed model can be improved by only modifying the training data set!

It is definitely true that the performance of an ML system greatly depends on the quality of the data used to train and tune it, and usually it is not possible to improve the performance by just adding more data or using a more complex model. From my own experience, it is also true that it is usually more beneficial to spend time on either collecting more high-quality data, or performing data cleaning to improve the overall quality of the existing data, rather than experimentinng with more sophisticated models.
