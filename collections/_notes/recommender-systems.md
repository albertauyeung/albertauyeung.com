## Miscellaneous

Main approaches of making recommendations (Iskold 2007):

- Personalized recommendation - recommend things based on the individual's past behavior
- Social recommendation - recommend things based on the past behavior of similar users
- Item recommendation - recommend things based on the thing itself
- A combination of the three approaches above

<li><b>Difficulties in evaluating recommender systems</b>
<ol>
<li>Different systems may be better or worse on different data sets:<br>
There are data sets where there are many more users than items (e.g. MovieLens), while there are also data sets which have many more items than users (e.g. recommendation of research papers)<br>
There are also differences in rating density, rating scale, and other properties of data sets.
